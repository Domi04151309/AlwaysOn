This update improves the display of all-day events by removing time indicators.
A crash that could occur when no events are present has been fixed. A new option
allows the Always-On Display (AOD) to be hidden during Do Not Disturb mode. AOD
behavior has been refined, particularly in how it interacts with notifications.
Translations have been updated, including enhancements to the French language
support. The update also includes performance and stability improvements, along
with dependency and code quality updates.
